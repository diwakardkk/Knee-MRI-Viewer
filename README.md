# Knee MRI Viewer and ROI Visualizer

This project provides a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing 3D knee MRI volumes. The application enables users to view individual slices, identify regions of interest (ROIs) based on metadata, and interactively analyze medical images. It also supports zooming, downloading visualizations, and exploring localized slices for diagnostic purposes.

This tool is designed to assist radiologists and researchers in studying knee conditions, including ACL injuries.

- View MRI volumes with slice-by-slice visualization.
- Highlight and localize regions of interest (ROIs) using metadata.
- Interactive zooming and downloading of visualizations.
- Supports three classes:
  - Healthy
  - Partially Injured
  - Completely Ruptured
